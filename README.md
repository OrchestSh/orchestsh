# OrchestSh

OrchestSh Executor, the element from OrchestSh that executes the logic. Is not magic, it's a collection of many years of experience.

## Install

For install run as root:

```bash
# wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orchestsh/orchestsh/master/installer.sh | sh

```

By default, (and the only option at this stage) the file will be installed in ```/usr/bin/```

If you want to update use the same command as the installation.

**NOTE** This is an alpha version, **not** recommended for public use yet.
